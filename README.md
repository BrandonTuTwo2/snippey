# [Snippey: A code Snippet Saver](https://snippey.netlify.app/home) 
Fun little web application mainly for learning how to interface with MongoDB. This web app allows users (you reading this!) to login and create, save and tag common code snippets you think that could be reused or you just want to admire.

## How to use
-   Login
-   Bottom right there is a button you can click to add a sticky note, consisting of a title, body and optional tags
-   click submit and it'll save it to your account
-   Use the search button to filter by tags

## Tech Used
- React.ts
- Typescript
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Node.js
- Netlify 
- Netlify Identity
- Tailwind
- Shadcn
- Vite


## Next Steps
- Probably add a feature to sort by names
- Feature to edit tags
- Add a feature to handle sticky notes with duplicate names
